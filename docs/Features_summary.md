Auto-routine of wires: Shortest path algorithm performs bi-directional recursion to avoid symbols in the horizontal or vertical direction based on the orientation of the wire segment.

Selection of multiple symbols: the points from when a cursor starts dragging till it stops is used to create a bounding box and all symbols within that selected area are selected and the symbols are highlighted as a result.

## Interface Definition
All interface used in the project are defined in the interface.md file found in `docs/`, a file for each module. There are also two other files, `common_types.md` and `notes.md`. `common_types.md` contains all the new type definitions we had to agree on, and `notes.md` contains notes on our design decisions.

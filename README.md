# HLP 2021 Project
This is the HLP group project for team 5.
## Running the Demo

#### First time running
1. In the root directory, open up the command prompt
2. Run the following code
    - Windows: ```build```
    - Linux: ```build.sh```
3. If the program fails to run, go to the original skeleton code, retrieve the file ```build.fsx```, and paste it into the root directory, then repeat step 2 again.

#### Subsequent times
1. In the root directory, open up the command prompt
2. Run the following code
    - ```npm run dev```

## File structure

## Interface Definition
All interface used in the project are defined in the interface.md file found in `docs/`, a file for each module. There are also two other files, `common_types.md` and `notes.md`. `common_types.md` contains all the new type definitions we had to agree on, and `notes.md` contains notes on our design decisions.
